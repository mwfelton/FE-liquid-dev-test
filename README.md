# Shopify Developer Test (WRTIE UP)

## Time Spent
2 hours

## Planning stage

My typical approach would be to build a reusable product grid (collection) section that renders a shared product card snippet. The section would be responsible for sourcing products via a selected collection in the Shopify customiser, while the product card handles all product-level rendering. Due to the constraints of the project setup, this structure is represented within template.liquid.

For product badges such as “Bestseller”, I would ideally use product metafields rather than tags for a more explicit way to manage that and avoid overloading tags. I'd apply theme level settings to style them on the shopify side.

## Comments
I didn't feel a need to go overboard trying to add JS and guessing functionality, maybe the carousels could have linked to the images to be swipeable with a click and drag.

slightly limited by the structure but able to replicate the design easily.
